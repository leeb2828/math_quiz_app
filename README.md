# Simple Math Quiz App

## How to use this project
Download the files using this command from the terminal:
```
$ git clone https://github.com/leeb2828/simple_quiz_app
```
I would recommend setting up a virtual environment first, but you don't have to. <br />
In your terminal, navigate to the folder where the project is and run 
```
$ pip install flask
$ python3 app.py
```
In your browser, type "http://localhost:5000"


## How to set up a virtual environment in flask
From your terminal, navigate to the correct folder.
```
$ python3 -m venv env 
```
NOTE: You don't have to name your virtual environment "env". <br />
To activate the virtual environment, run 
```
$ source env/bin/activate
```
To deactivate your environment:
```
$ deactivate
```
